I am Sajith Dilshan, a twenty six years old guy from a beautiful island called Sri Lanka. I grew up in Colombo, went to Nalanda College Colombo 10 and I graduated from the Computer Science and Engineering Department of University of Moratuwa. 

I am mostly interested in learning cryptography, Machine learning, and latest web technologies such as HTML5 and CSS3, and most of all my favorite subject is Mathematics and I just love calculus. 

I like to play chess and badminton. Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad and The Big Bang Theory are my favorite TV shows. Well I guess that's all about me.
